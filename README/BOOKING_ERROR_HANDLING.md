# Booking Error Handling Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced the booking system to properly handle monthly usage limit exceeded errors with user-friendly experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. BookWorkerButton Component Updates

**File**: `components/book-worker-button.tsx`

#### Added Imports

```tsx
import { toast } from "sonner";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
```

#### Enhanced Error Handling

- **403 Status Detection**: Specifically handles 403 (Forbidden) responses
- **Limit Error Detection**: Checks for "limit" or "exceeded" keywords in error messages
- **User-Friendly Experience**: Shows toast notification instead of generic error

#### Error Flow

1. **Detection**: Catches 403 responses with limit-related error messages
2. **UI Cleanup**: Closes booking dialog and resets form
3. **Notification**: Shows informative toast with auto-dismiss
4. **Redirection**: Automatically redirects to pricing page after 2 seconds

### 2. Success Enhancement

- Added success toast notification for successful bookings
- Improved user feedback throughout the booking process

## API Response Format

The `/api/jobs` endpoint returns the following for limit exceeded:

```json
{
  "error": "Monthly booking limit exceeded",
  "message": "Upgrade to Pro plan for unlimited bookings",
  "needsUpgrade": true
}
```

**Status**: 403 Forbidden

## User Experience Flow

### When Limit is Exceeded:

1. User attempts to book a worker
2. System detects monthly limit reached
3. Toast notification appears: "Monthly booking limit reached!"
4. User automatically redirected to pricing page
5. User can upgrade to continue booking

### Success Case:

1. User creates booking successfully
2. Success toast appears: "Booking request sent!"
3. User redirected to bookings page

## Benefits

- **Clear Communication**: Users understand why booking failed
- **Seamless Upgrade Path**: Direct path to pricing/upgrade
- **No Confusion**: Eliminates generic error messages
- **Better Conversion**: Guides users to upgrade naturally

## Testing

To test the error handling:

1. Create 7+ bookings as a free customer
2. On the 8th booking attempt, verify:
   - Toast notification appears
   - Automatic redirect to pricing page
   - No generic error message shown

## Technical Details

- Uses Sonner toast system for notifications
- Next.js router for navigation
- Graceful error handling with fallbacks
- Maintains existing error handling for other error types

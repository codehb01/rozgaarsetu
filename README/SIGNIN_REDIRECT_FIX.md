# Sign-In Redirect Bug Fix with Animated Progress Bar

## Problem
After signing in with Google, users experienced:
1. Choose Google account → Sign in
2. 3-4 second blank/loading period with no visual feedback
3. Finally redirected to onboarding/dashboard

This created poor UX with no indication that something was happening.

## Solution

### 1. Animated Circular Progress Bar Loading
**File**: `app/auth-redirect/page.tsx`

Clean, minimal loading screen with animated circular progress bar:
- **Animated circular progress bar** - Shows loading progress visually
- **Smooth animation** - Progress increments from 0 to 100%
- **Clean centered design** - Just the progress bar, nothing else
- **Dark mode support** - Works perfectly in both themes
- **Indigo color** - Matches app theme (rgb(79 70 229))

**Component**: `components/ui/animated-circular-progress-bar.tsx`

Features:
- SVG-based circular progress
- Smooth transitions with CSS
- Customizable colors
- Percentage display inside circle
- Size: 48 units (size-48)

### 2. Profile Check API
**File**: `app/api/user/check-profile/route.ts`

API endpoint that:
- Gets authenticated Clerk user
- Checks user role in database
- Returns appropriate redirect URL:
  - `/onboarding` if no profile/role
  - `/worker/dashboard` if WORKER role
  - `/customer/dashboard` if CUSTOMER role
  - `/` as fallback on error

### 3. Updated Sign-In Flow
**File**: `app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`

Changed to redirect to loading page:
```tsx
<SignIn forceRedirectUrl="/auth-redirect" />
```

## Flow (With Animated Progress)

```
User signs in → /auth-redirect
                       ↓
               [CIRCULAR PROGRESS BAR]
               - Animates 0% → 90%
               - Clean, centered display
                       ↓
               Fetch /api/user/check-profile
                       ↓
               Progress jumps to 100%
                       ↓
               Small delay (300ms)
                       ↓
               Redirect to destination
        ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
        ↓                             ↓
   No Profile/Role            Complete Profile
        ↓                             ↓
   /onboarding              /worker or /customer
                               dashboard
```

## Loading Screen Features

### Visual Design:
- ✨ **Centered circular progress** - Clean, professional look
- ✨ **Animated percentage** - Shows 0% → 100%
- ✨ **Indigo color scheme** - Matches app branding
- ✨ **Minimal design** - No distracting elements
- ✨ **Size 48** - Perfect visibility without being too large

### Animation:
- **Progress increments**: 10% every 300ms
- **Stops at 90%**: Waits for API response
- **Jumps to 100%**: When redirect URL received
- **Final delay**: 300ms to show completion
- **Smooth transitions**: Built into component

### Technical:
- **Light mode**: White background, indigo progress
- **Dark mode**: Gray-950 background, indigo progress
- **Fixed positioning**: Covers full viewport
- **Prevents scroll**: Sets `overflow: hidden` on body
- **Clean exit**: Restores scroll on unmount

## User Experience Improvements

**Before:**
- ❌ 3-4 second blank screen
- ❌ No indication of what's happening
- ❌ User confusion ("Is it broken?")

**After:**
- ✅ Animated circular progress bar
- ✅ Visual percentage counter (0% → 100%)
- ✅ Clean, professional loading state
- ✅ User sees clear progress
- ✅ Satisfying completion at 100%

## Files Changed

1. ✅ Created: `app/auth-redirect/page.tsx` - Progress bar loading screen
2. ✅ Installed: `components/ui/animated-circular-progress-bar.tsx` - MagicUI component
3. ✅ Created: `app/api/user/check-profile/route.ts` - Profile check API
4. ✅ Modified: `app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` - Redirect to loading page

## Technical Details

### Progress Bar Component:
```tsx
<AnimatedCircularProgressBar
  max={100}
  min={0}
  value={progress}
  gaugePrimaryColor="rgb(79 70 229)"
  gaugeSecondaryColor="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"
  className="size-48"
/>
```

### Progress Logic:
1. **Initial**: Progress starts at 0%
2. **Animation**: Increments by 10% every 300ms
3. **Pause**: Stops at 90% while waiting for API
4. **Complete**: Sets to 100% when redirect URL received
5. **Redirect**: 300ms delay to show 100%, then navigate

### Styling:
- **Container**: `fixed inset-0` - Full viewport coverage
- **Layout**: `flex items-center justify-center` - Centered
- **Background**: White (light) / Gray-950 (dark)
- **Progress bar**: Size-48 (192px)

### Performance:
- Component already installed (MagicUI)
- Lightweight SVG-based animation
- Hardware-accelerated CSS transitions
- Minimal JavaScript overhead

# RozgaarSetu Freemium Model Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive freemium subscription model that tracks usage limits for both customers and workers, with considerate upgrade prompts for low-income workers.

## 📊 Plan Structure

### For Customers

- **Free**: 7 bookings/month
- **Pro (₹499/month)**: Unlimited bookings + priority scheduling

### For Workers

- **Free**: 25 leads/month
- **Boost (₹199/month)**: Unlimited leads + featured profile
- **Pro (₹199/month)**: Everything in Boost + verified badge + premium insights

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

- `UserSubscription` table: Tracks user plans and expiry dates
- `UsageTracking` table: Monthly usage counters (bookings, leads, completed jobs)
- Proper indexing for performance

### 2. Subscription Management Service (`lib/subscription-service.ts`)

- Plan limits configuration
- Usage tracking and validation
- Automatic subscription expiry handling
- Dashboard statistics

### 3. Usage Tracking System (`lib/usage-tracker.ts`)

- Real-time usage increment
- Limit checking before actions
- Worker-friendly logic (never completely blocked)

### 4. API Endpoints

- `/api/user/usage-stats` - Get user's current usage statistics
- `/api/user/subscription` - Manage subscription upgrades
- Updated job creation API with limit checking

### 5. UI Components

- `UsageTracker` component with real-time progress bars
- Updated pricing page with customer/worker sections
- Dashboard integration showing usage stats
- Smart upgrade prompts at 80% usage

### 6. Business Logic

- **Customers**: Hard limit at 7 bookings (blocked from creating more)
- **Workers**: Soft limit at 25 leads (notified but not blocked)
- Automatic expiry handling
- Monthly usage reset

## 🚀 How It Works

### For Customers

1. Free users can create up to 7 bookings per month
2. Usage tracker shows progress (red at 100%, amber at 80%+)
3. Upgrade prompt appears when approaching limit
4. Pro users get unlimited bookings + priority features

### For Workers

1. Free users can receive up to 25 leads per month
2. After limit, they're notified but can still work (worker-friendly)
3. Upgrade prompts encourage but don't force subscription
4. Paid plans provide unlimited leads + visibility boosts

### Usage Tracking

- Automatically increments when:
  - Customer creates a booking (`UsageTracker.trackBooking()`)
  - Worker receives a lead (`UsageTracker.trackLead()`)
  - Job is completed (`UsageTracker.trackJobCompletion()`)

## 🎨 UI Features

### Dashboard Integration

- Real-time usage progress bars
- Plan badges (Free/Boost/Pro)
- Smart upgrade prompts
- Expiry date display

### Pricing Page

- Separate sections for customers vs workers
- Clear feature differentiation
- Transparent pricing with no hidden fees
- "Why upgrade?" benefits section

## 🔐 Security & Performance

- Usage limits checked server-side
- Proper authentication with Clerk
- Database indexes for fast queries
- Type-safe with TypeScript

## 🎯 Business Benefits

1. **Revenue Generation**: Multiple subscription tiers
2. **User Retention**: Freemium model encourages adoption
3. **Fair Monetization**: Respects worker income constraints
4. **Scalable**: Usage-based limits prevent abuse
5. **Growth**: Upgrade prompts drive conversions

## 📈 Next Steps to Deploy

1. ✅ Prisma schema updated
2. ✅ All components built and tested
3. ✅ API endpoints created
4. ✅ Build passes successfully
5. 🔄 **Ready for Vercel deployment**

## 🛠️ Quick Setup

1. Run `npm run build` (already passing)
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Run database migrations in production
4. Start tracking user engagement and conversions!

The freemium model is now fully integrated and ready for production use. Users will see usage counters on their dashboards and receive contextual upgrade prompts when needed.

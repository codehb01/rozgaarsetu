## üêõ Debugging

### If booking doesn't work, check:

#### 1. Browser Console (F12)
Look for error messages or failed network requests.

**Expected logs:**
```javascript
BookWorkerButton: Book button clicked { loading: false, step: 3 }
BookWorkerButton: Submitting booking { workerId: "...", description: "...", ... }
BookWorkerButton: Response status 200
BookWorkerButton: Booking created successfully { job: { id: "...", ... } }
```

**Common errors:**
- ‚ùå "Unauthorized" ‚Üí Not logged in
- ‚ùå "User not found" ‚Üí User hasn't completed onboarding
- ‚ùå "Access denied. CUSTOMER role required" ‚Üí User is WORKER, not CUSTOMER
- ‚ùå "Invalid worker" ‚Üí Worker doesn't exist or wrong role
- ‚ùå "Missing required fields" ‚Üí Form data incomplete

#### 2. Network Tab (F12 ‚Üí Network)
**Check POST request to `/api/jobs`:**

**Request:**
- Method: POST
- Headers: Content-Type: application/json
- Payload should contain:
  ```json
  {
    "workerId": "clxxx...",
    "description": "Fix leaking faucet",
    "details": "Kitchen sink is dripping",
    "datetime": "2025-10-06T14:00:00.000Z",
    "location": "123 Main St",
    "charge": 500
  }
  ```

**Response:**
- Status: 200 OK
- Body should contain:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "job": {
      "id": "clxxx...",
      "customerId": "clxxx...",
      "workerId": "clxxx...",
      "description": "Fix leaking faucet",
      "status": "PENDING",
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

#### 3. Server Console (VS Code Terminal)
Look for errors in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running.

**Common errors:**
- Database connection errors
- Prisma query errors
- Foreign key constraint violations
- Authentication errors

#### 4. Database Query (if needed)
```sql
-- Check if job was created
SELECT * FROM "Job" ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check customer exists
SELECT id, name, email, role FROM "User" WHERE role = 'CUSTOMER';

-- Check worker exists
SELECT id, name, email, role FROM "User" WHERE role = 'WORKER';
```
